## Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

This program is based on a game of chance called **Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock**.\
The game was invented by *Sam Kass* and *Karen Bryla* and is basically an extention of the traditional game of **Rock Paper Scissors**.

Learn more about the game [here](http://www.samkass.com/theories/RPSSL.html).

The game was mentioned several times is the popular TV series [Big Bang Theory](https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Rock,_Paper,_Scissors,_Lizard,_Spock) which is where I came to know about this game.

The rules of the game can be found in the `Game` menu.

This project is my own attempt to implement the game in Pyhton programming language as a computer program where you as a player can play against the computer.
